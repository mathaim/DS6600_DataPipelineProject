# DS6600_DataPipelineProject

#### Introduction (6 points): describes the general topic and purpose for collecting and working with the proposed data.

#### Background (6 points): reviews existing related work including published articles and public datasets, with citations for both.

#### Data (6 points): lists potential sources for raw data, with citations, along with descriptions of the mechanism through which each data source shares data (through an API, web-scraping, a CSV file, etc.). Also, find and describe the licensing information for each data source to determine whether and under what restrictions you are allowed to use the data.

#### Potential analyses (6 points): identifies the key features/variables in the data sources listed in the previous section and provides some thoughts on the kinds of analyses that you would like to include on a public-facing dashboard. (Note: when I say “analysis”, I don’t necessarily mean machine learning. You are free to use ML or other heavy models, if you have the background and desire to do so, but these analyses can be simple, exploratory, and descriptive like cross-tabs, histograms, and correlation tables as these simple analyses usually are very effective at communicating key ideas.)


#### Challenges (6 points): discusses what some of the biggest challenges may be as you proceed through the rest of the project. If you are not sure that something within your plan will work out, describe an alternative plan to quickly turn to in case the original plan doesn’t succeed.
